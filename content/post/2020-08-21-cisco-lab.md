Zhongshan Institute of UESTC operates an advanced Cisco lab for students and the public. Our firm designed, developed and deployed a reservation system to manage the equipment usage. The system allows users to reserve their time slot, and instructors can reserve all equipment at once for in-class teaching. The system is also capable of collecting usage statistics and generating reports for different administrative purposes.
